/**
 * C1: Sodium's DirectionalVisGraph.resolveWithDirections, computed with 16-bit row masks instead of a cell-by-cell DFS.
 *
 * <p>What Sodium computes: for a direction set D (one direction per axis, e.g. down + north + west) and each of the three faces F
 * opposite to D, a flood from every open cell on F that may only step in D's three directions through open (non-opaque) cells;
 * the face F "sees" each D-face that some flooded cell touches, and itself if it has any open cell. Its DFS shares one visited set
 * across the seeds of a face and never stops early (the early-out compares against a mask whose bit 10 is always set, since
 * GraphDirectionSet.of(~set) is 1 << (~set & 31)), so the result is exactly that union: the faces reachable by monotone paths.
 *
 * <p>Monotone paths make the reachable set a single sweep: layers in D's y order, rows in D's z order, and inside a row an
 * occluded fill along D's x direction (Kogge-Stone, 4 steps). A cell is reached iff it is open and its predecessor in some D
 * direction is reached or it is a seed, which is what the sweep evaluates in dependency order.
 *
 * <p>Bit layout matches Sodium's BitArray of opaque blocks: index x | z << 4 | y << 8, 64 bits per long, so long (y << 2 | z >> 2)
 * holds rows z & ~3 .. z | 3 of layer y, 16 bits each, x in the low bits.
